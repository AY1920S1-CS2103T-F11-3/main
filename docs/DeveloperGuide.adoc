=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

Refer to <<Design-Logic, 2.3 Logic Component>> to view the Class Diagram of the Logic Component.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ABCBookParser` class to parse the user command, depending on the current mode of the App.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a note).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteNoteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the CardBook, FileBook, PasswordBook and NoteBook data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>`, `ObservableList<File>`,`ObservableList<Password>` and `ObservableList<Note>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SecureIT data in json format and read it back, including Password Book, File Book, Note Book and Card Book.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Analyse Password
The following class diagram is the current structure of the `Analyser` component, using `DictionaryAnalyser` as an example:

image::AnalyserClassDiagram.png[]

The `Analyser` component,

* can analyse the current list of `Password` object to produce a list of analysis `Results`.

==== Proposed Implementation
The analyse password makes use of various analysers.
Each type of analyser implements it's own implementation of `#analyse()` , and inspects the following aspects of the password:

* Complexity (Strength)
* Uniqueness
* Similarity
* Commonly-used passwords
* Commonly-used sequences

Given below is the example usage of how the analysis for commonly-used passwords is implemented, using the `DictionaryAnalyser`.

Step 1. The user inputs `analyse` into the command line. An `AnalysePasswordCommand` is generated and executed by `Logic`.

Step 2. On `#execute`, AnalysePasswordCommand retrieves the current list of passwords via `Model#getFilteredPasswordList()`.
It also retrieves the required analysers via `#getRequiredAnalysers()`. Each analyser will then `#analyse` the list of passwords.

Step 3. In the case of `DictionaryAnalyser`, each subsequence of the particular password is checked against a common-password dictionary
Every match found is appended to the list of `Match` objects. The following sequence diagram explains how this is done:

image::GetAllMatchesSequence.png[]

Step 4. An `AnalysisReport` compiles all the `Results` of each analyser into a string-formatted report for the user.

Step 5. Should the user wish to view a more detailed report for a specific password, user may input `analyse strong/<index>`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the overall analyse functionality works:

image::AnalysePasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How analyse/analyse strong executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Always analyse the entire list of Password objects for every "analyse" command,
even if the list of Passwords was unchanged.

** Pros: Easy to implement, not required to check state if the current list of Passwords has been modified.

** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed of the programme.

* **Alternative 2:** Save in memory the result produced by the Analyser objects, and update result upon modification of
list of Passwords (e.g. new passwords added/ passwords deleted.)

** Pros: Performance of programme will be a lot faster.

** Cons: Hard to implement. Have to keep track of state of the list of Password objects and check if the list has been modified
from the last time they were analysed.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== General Data Encryption

==== Initialization and Validation

All data files of SecureIT are encrypted with a master password set by the user. The initialization and validation of the master password are handled by `*TestStorage*`.

The following diagram shows how the master password is initialized when the user uses the app for the first time and validated for subsequent uses of the app.

image::InitPasswordActivityDiagram.png[]

Note that to protect users' data, the main components of the app (`*Storage*`, `*Ui*`, `*Logic*`, `*Model*`) can only be initialised with a correct master password.

Also, the app does not store the master password itself. Instead, during initialization, the app encrypts a magic word using the password and stores it in the file system. For validation, the app tries to decrypt the stored magic word using the password given and checks if the original word is obtained. If the password given is correct, the original magic word should be obtained.

==== Encryption Method

The following sequence diagram explains how the `*EncryptionUtil*` class encrypts an input byte array using a password.

image::EncryptionUtilSequenceDiagram.png[]

The process of encrypting a byte array is outlined as follows:

Step 1. A key (`*SecretKey key*`) is generated from the password string (`*pwd*`) and a specified encryption method (`*PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES*`) via a utility class (`*SecretKeyFactory*`).

Step 2. A set of parameter specification (`*PBEParameterSpec paramSpec*`) is generated with hardcoded parameters (`*SALT*`, `*ITERATION*`). Hardcoded parameters ensure that the same password can always be correctly validated at different times.

Step 3. A `*Cipher*` class is constructed with the same encryption method specified above (`*PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES*`) and initialised with the key and the set of parameter specifications.

Step 4. The `*doFinal*` method conducts the actual encryption on the input array and returns the encrypted byte array.

The decryption process is similar to the encryption process, except that the `*ENCRYPT_MODE*` is changed to `*DECRYPT_MODE*`. The same password is necessary to decrypt an encrypted byte array to its original content.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::fileencryption[]
=== File Management
SecureIT does not store users' encrypted files directly. Instead, it reads the files' data, carries out the encryption, and replaces the original files with encrypted ones in users' file system. Meanwhile, it also maintains records of files that it encrypts, represented by `*EncryptedFile*` class, in an internal data structure, `*FileBook*`.

The following diagram illustrates how the record of an encrypted file is represented internally.

image::FileModelClassDiagram.png[Diagram, 700]

The `*FileBook*`, managed by the app's `*ModelManager*`, keeps a `*UniqueFileList*`. The list encapsulates an internal mechanism to prevent file duplication. Each entry in the list represents a record of an encrypted file.

An `*EncryptedFile*` must have the following attributes:  a `*FileName*`, a `*FilePath*`, and a `*FileStatus*`. While the first two attributes allow the app to locate the file, the file status provides users with an indication of the current state of the file. It defaults to `*ACTIVE*` for newly encrypted/added files.

Two timestamps, `*EncryptedAt*` and `*ModifiedAt*`, provide users with more details about the file. These two attributes may not always be available. For example, encrypted files added with `add` command do not contain this information.

Lastly, while a `*ViewableFile*` contains the file's content for preview. It is a generic class which is extendable to accommodate even more file types in future. The `*FilePreviewPanel*`, which is a `*UI*` component, depends on `*ViewableFile*` to render the preview.

==== Logic

The user can perform the following operations: `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `add`, `remove`, `move`, `rename`, and `preview`. There are two differences between the commands of the file manager and those of the address book. First, some file commands require a password for execution. Second, most file commands involve interaction with the external file system.

The solution to the first difference is a `*FileCommandParser*` class which is similar to the `*Parser*` class, but it packages the password within the commands during parsing. It is illustrated in the class diagram below:

image::FileCommandParserClassDiagram.png[]

The second difference is addressed by the separation of access to the file system from the parser. For example, during encryption, at the parsing stage, an `*EncryptedFile toAdd*` is created without the knowledge of the actual file. Both the validation and encryption are carried out only at the execution stage. This is illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

image::EncryptSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Below is a summary of my considerations and analysis while developing the file manager:

. When to do file validation with the file system
+
*Alternative 1*: When a command is parsed +
*Pros*: There is no need to construct `*EncryptedFile*` objects for invalid files. +
*Cons*: Both the command parsing and execution require interaction with the file system. `*Parser*` violates the single responsibility principle.
+
*Alternative 2*: When a command is executed +
*Pros*: Interaction with the file system only occurs during execution. Easier to debug. +
*Cons*: Need to construct `*EncryptedFile*` when file information is not yet available. Cannot initialise `*ModifiedAt*` in the constructor.
+
Alternative 2 is chosen because according to single responsibility principle, `*Parser*` should only convert user input to correct command format, without the knowledge of the file.

. How to implement the file preview feature
+
*Alternative 1*: UI components read file content +
*Pros*: There is no need to create extra classes in `*Model*`, such as `*ViewableFile*`. +
*Cons*: UI components have to interact directly with the file system.
+
*Alternative 2*: Read file content during command execution +
*Pros*: File system access is limited to command execution time only. +
*Cons*: Need to pass the file content to the UI components via `*CommandResult*`.
+
Alternative 2 is chosen because it is better to keep all access to the file system in one place.

// end::fileencryption[]

=== Notes Feature
==== Open Note

The user is able to open a note in the note book in a separate panel to easily read and edit its contents.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the note is retrieved and edited through the UI via the `open` command.

image::OpenNoteSequenceDiagram.png[]

Below is the sub-diagram for retrieving the note through the `open` command.

image::OpenNoteSequenceDiagramRef.png[]

****
* Note that the sequence diagram for the `edit` command is similar to the `open` command shown above, hence is omitted.
****

Given below is an example usage of scenario of the `open` command in notes, where a user intends to open a note to read
or edit its contents.

*Step 1.* Through the `goto note` command, the user arrives at the notes component of the app. The user then executes the command
`open 1`.

*Step 2.* The app recognises that it is an `open` command and proceeds to check if the index `1` given is a valid index using
the `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` method.

*Step 3.* If the index given by the user is valid, the corresponding note will be retrieved. This note is shown to the user in a panel on the right
within the app.

*Step 4.* The user proceeds to edit the `Title`, `Description` and `Content` field of the note through this panel and saves his
edits using the save button. This executes the `Logic#EditNoteCommand()` which edits the note in the note book.

*Step 5.* The note book is now updated with the note edited by the user.


==== Undo/Redo
===== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the VersionedNoteBook, which extends NoteBook with a undo/redo history.
This history is stored in two stacks - the undo stack and the redo stack. The undo stack stores the states of NoteBooks
before the current state and the redo stack which stores the states of NoteBooks after the current state.
The key operations that support this mechanisms are:

`VersionedNoteBook#commit()` — Saves the current NoteBook state and its corresponding command in the undo stack.

`VersionedNoteBook#undo()` — Restores the previous note book state from the undo stack and returns its corresponding command
to inform the user what command is undone. It also stores the current state of the note book into the redo stack.

`VersionedNoteBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone note book state from the redo stack and returns its corresponding
command to inform the user what command is redone. It also stores the current state of the note book into the undo stack.

Below is a comprehensive activity diagram to illustrate how the undo & redo mechanism works.

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

Not all commands are undo-able. Undo-able commands are those that modifies the note book which includes: `add`, `delete`,
`clear`, `edit` and `open`.

====
* The `open` command is considered undo-able because it updates the number of access
to the note that is opened.
====

Below is an example run through of how the undo command is executed:

. User executes `undo` command which calls the `VersionedNoteBook#undo()`.
. This method call first checks if the undo stack is empty.
.. The undo stack will be empty if no undo-able command were called prior
to calling the `undo` command.
.. The undo mechanism will only proceed only if the undo stack is not empty,
else an `InvalidUndoException` will be thrown.
. The current state of the note book is then checked against the previous state of the note book.
.. In the event that they are the same, the
previous note book state is popped from the undo stack and the `undo` command is called recursively (starting from step 2).
This recursive call is performed until either the current and previous note book state are different or until the undo stack is empty.
.. In the event that they are different, proceed on to step 4.

. The current state of the note book is first stored in the redo stack.
. The note book is then reverted to the previous note book state. This same previous note book state is removed from
the undo stack.
. Undo command is complete.

====
* Step 3 is to prevent users from being able to perform `undo` actions when there is no change to be undone.
====


===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the entire note book.
** Pros: Less complex and easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* Alternative 2: Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Makes use of lesser memory.
** Cons: More complex to implement and more prone to bugs as each individual command must be correct to work correctly.

*The reason why we chose alternative 1:*
By adopting a simpler implementation, we aim to introduce less bugs into system. Furthermore, this implementation better
supports future extensions as undoable commands can be added much easier.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use two stacks to store the history of note book states - one for undo, one for redo.
** Pros: Very easy to implement.
** Cons: Using two data structures may incur additional overhead in terms of memory.

* Alternative 2: Use a single linked list to store the history of note book states which supports both undo and redo.
** Pros: May incur less overhead in terms of memory usage as only one data structure is used.
** Cons: More complex to implement.

*The reason why we chose alternative 1:*
It is less complex to implement and the code is much cleaner for better readability which also helps in future extensions.

==== Sort Note feature

Sorting of notes is handled by the MultipleSortByCond class, which allows the notes in the NoteBook to be sorted in
three different ways - by date modified, date added or number of access.

Below is a
class diagram to illustrate how the NoteBook class and MultipleSortByCond class interact with one another.

image::SortNoteClassDiagram.png[]

Sorting the note book rearranges the notes according to the sort conditions provided.

More than one of the conditions can be used to sort the notes in the note book at one time, with the first condition
having the greatest precedence.

Example: `sort by/NumOfAccess DateAdded`

* NumOfAccess and DateAdded are the sort conditions, with NumOfAccess having greater precedence over DateAdded.

This is handled by the `MultipleSortByCond#buildComparator()`, which takes in the sort conditions specified by the user and returns a `MultipleCondNoteComparator` object that is used to sort the list of notes
in NoteBook.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
