=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

Refer to <<Design-Logic, 2.3 Logic Component>> to view the Class Diagram of the Logic Component.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ABCBookParser` class to parse the user command, depending on the current mode of the App.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a note).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteNoteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the CardBook, FileBook, PasswordBook and NoteBook data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>`, `ObservableList<File>`,`ObservableList<Password>` and `ObservableList<Note>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SecureIT data in json format and read it back, including Password Book, File Book, Note Book and Card Book.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Analyse Password
The following class diagram is the current structure of the `Analyser` component, using `DictionaryAnalyser` as an example:

image::AnalyserClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : **TODO**
//link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Analyser` component,

* can analyse the current list of `Password` object to produce a list of analysis `Results`.

==== Proposed Implementation
The analyse password makes use of various analysers.
Each type of analyser implements it's own implementation of `#analyse()` , and inspects the following aspects of the password:

* Complexity (Strength)
* Uniqueness
* Similarity
* Commonly-used passwords
* Commonly-used sequences

Given below is the example usage of how the analysis for commonly-used passwords is implemented, using the `DictionaryAnalyser`.

Step 1. The user inputs `analyse` into the command line. An `AnalysePasswordCommand` is generated and executed by `Logic`.

Step 2. On `#execute`, AnalysePasswordCommand retrieves the current list of passwords via `Model#getFilteredPasswordList()`.
It also retrieves the required analysers via `#getRequiredAnalysers()`. Each analyser will then `#analyse` the list of passwords.

Step 3. In the case of `DictionaryAnalyser`, each subsequence of the particular password is checked against a common-password dictionary
Every match found is appended to the list of `Match` objects. The following sequence diagram explains how this is done:

image::GetAllMatchesSequence.png[]

Step 4. An `AnalysisReport` compiles all the `Results` of each analyser into a string-formatted report for the user.

Step 5. Should the user wish to view a more detailed report for a specific password, user may input `analyse strong/<index>`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the overall analyse functionality works:

image::AnalysePasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How analyse/analyse strong executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Always analyse the entire list of Password objects for every "analyse" command,
even if the list of Passwords was unchanged.

** Pros: Easy to implement, not required to check state if the current list of Passwords has been modified.

** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of speed of the programme.

* **Alternative 2:** Save in memory the result produced by the Analyser objects, and update result upon modification of
list of Passwords (e.g. new passwords added/ passwords deleted.)

** Pros: Performance of programme will be a lot faster.

** Cons: Hard to implement. Have to keep track of state of the list of Password objects and check if the list has been modified
from the last time they were analysed.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Data Encryption

==== Initialization and Validation

All data files of SecureIT are encrypted with a master password set by the user. The initialization and validation of the master password is handled by `TestStorage`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the master password is initialized when the user uses the app for the first time, and validated for subsequent uses of the app.

image::InitPasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

Note that the main components of the app (`Storage`, `Ui`, `Logic`, `Model`) can only be initialised with a correct master password.

The app does not store the master password itself. Instead, during initialization, the app encrypts a magic word using the password and stores it in the storage. For validation, the app tries to decrypt the stored magic word using the password given and compares if the original word is obtained. If the password given is correct, the decrypted magic word should be the same as the original one.

==== Encryption Method

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
