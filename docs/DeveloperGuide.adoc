=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

Refer to <<Design-Logic, 2.3 Logic Component>> to view the Class Diagram of the Logic Component.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ABCBookParser` class to parse the user command, depending on the current mode of the App.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a note).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteNoteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the CardBook, FileBook, PasswordBook and NoteBook data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>`, `ObservableList<File>`,`ObservableList<Password>` and `ObservableList<Note>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SecureIT data in json format and read it back, including Password Book, File Book, Note Book and Card Book.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Generate Password

This section provides implementation details on the password generation feature.

==== Overview
The purpose of password generation is to provide users with a hassle-free way to generate random, secure passwords.

By default, the password generation feature will generate a random password that:

* is 10 letters long

* includes lower case alphabets

* includes upper case alphabets

* includes numerals

* includes Special characters

However, users can alternatively choose to customise any of the aforementioned fields as per their needs through their input.

The generation of truly random passwords is made possible through the use of the `java.security.SecureRandom` API.
It provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG) that will be used in the password generation.

The intricacies will be further reviewed in the **Implementation** section below.



==== Implementation

The following activity diagram summarises the general steps taken during password generation:


.Summary flow of actions during password generation.
image::GeneratePasswordActivityDiagram.png[]

The steps below outline explicity the generation of passwords :

*  The user input is `#parse()` by the `GeneratePasswordCommandParser`.

* Based on the user input, a `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` is instantiated.
** If the user input includes optional prefixes to customise configuration, we modify the attributes of the `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` through various setter methods.

** Else, the default `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` instantiated through the static method `GeneratePasswordDescriptor#getDefaultConfiguration()`.


[NOTE]
The `GeneratePasswordDescriptor` is an object that encapsulates the settings of the **configuration** used for password generation.

* Upon `GeneratePasswordCommand` is instantiated with the given configuration.

* Upon `#execute()`, the static method `GeneratorUtil#generateRandomPassword()` is invoked:

** Based on the configuration, the relevant character sets (lower-case alphabets, upper case alphabets, numerals, special characters) are added into a list.

** The `GeneratorUtil` class uses the method `java.security.SecureRandom.nextInt()` to choose a random characters set, followed by a random character within the set to be used in the new password.

** This process of choosing a character to include in the password is repeated for the length of the password.

* The generated password is then checked to see if it includes all the user requirements (ie. whether it includes all the character sets specified by the user.)

* This process of generating a password is repeated until the user requirements are met.

The activity diagram below depicts the way in which a password is generated by the method `GeneratorUtil#generateRandomPassword()`:

.Summary flow of actions during the invokation of #generateRandomassword().
image::GenerateMethodActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

These are the considerations we came across when implementing the generate feature:

===== Aspect: How to generate a random password
|===
|**Alternative 1 (Current choice)**|**Alternative 2**
How to generate a truly random password
| **Randomly choose a character set, followed by a character within the set to include in password**: +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Randomness is achieved because there is no predictability in the way a character set, or character is chosen.


[underline]_Cons:_ +
Efficiency is compromised. Generating a password this way may produce a password that does not meet user configuration
(e.g. random password does not include special characters, although it was supposed to).
As such, program needs to keep producing new random password until all the user configuration are met.
|**Ensuring all user configurations are met by hard coding a pattern in the way character sets are included** +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Efficiency is achieved. We are guaranteed to generate a password that matches users' configuration everytime (e.g. lower case -> upper case -> numeral -> special case patter) +

[underline]_Cons:_ +
Randomness is compromised. Generating passwords in such a pattern makes the password style very predictable, hence compromising randomness and security.

2+|**Why did we choose Alternative 1:** +
Although less time efficient, the password generated is more random, and thus more secure. Generating a secure password is inline with our use case, and so is a more important factor.

=== Analyse Password

This section provides implementation details on the analyse password feature.

==== Overview

The purpose of analysing passwords is to provide users with information on the level of security of their passwords.

The user can either :

1. View a summary table of results of all password by inputting `"analyse"` OR

2. View a detailed review of a specific password by inputting `"analyse strong/INDEX"`

SecureIT analyses 6 core components of every `Password`, using various `Analysers`. The following table summarises the functionality of each `Analyser`:

|===
||**Purpose / Checks for**
|**UniqueAnalyser **: +
| Checks that every password is unique.
|**StrengthAnalyser **: +
| Checks the complexity of every password.
|**SimilarityAnalyser **: +
| Checks that no two accounts share a password that is at least 70% similar.

|**DictionaryAnalyser **: +
| Checks that password does not contain any commonly-used passwords. (e.g. "password")

|**SequenceAnalyser **: +
| Checks that password does not contain any commonly-used sequences. (e.g. "ABC")
|**KeyboardAnalyser **: +
| Checks that password does not contain any commonly-used keyboard patterns. (e.g. "qwerty")

|===

The following class diagram is the current structure of the `Analyser` component.

.Class diagram depicting the structure of the Analyser component.
image::AnalyserClassDiagram.png[]

In summary,

1. The analysis of passwords is initiated upon `#execute()` of the `AnalysePasswordCommand`.

2. Each `Analyser` analyses every password in the password book.

3. The analysis of each password produces the respective `Result` for that password.

4. These `Results` are compiled and written into a `AnalysisReport`, which is then shown to the user in the form of a summary table.

5. Users can opt to view a detailed report for a specific password to get more information on the respective `Result`.


==== Implementation

On `#execute()`, AnalysePasswordCommand retrieves the current list of passwords via `Model#getFilteredPasswordList()`.
It also retrieves the required analysers via `#getRequiredAnalysers()`.

Each `Analyser` has it's own implementation of `#analyse()`, which will subsequently be invoked by the `AnalysePasswordCommand` given the current list of passwords.

The following sequence diagram breaks down the general flows of events stated above, and in the context of a `DictionaryAnalyser`:

[NOTE]
The other `Analysers` are instantiated in a similar fashion in `#getRequiredAnalsyers()` and hence omitted to the make the diagram less congested.

.Sequence diagram depicting the flow of analysing the list of passwords, in the context of DictionaryAnalyser.
image::AnalysePasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

In the following discussion, we will be reviewing how `Results` are produced for each password, in the context of the `DictionaryAnalyser`.

In the case of the `DictionaryAnalyser#analyse()`, every password is checked to see if it contains any subsequence that is listed as a commonly used password in the instantiated `Dictionary`. This is done in the internal method `#getAllMatches(password)` within `#analyse()`.

[NOTE]
The `Dictionary` is an object that maps commonly used passwords to their ranking in terms of how commonly used they are. (e.g. "123456" is mapped to rank 1 in the Dictionary because it is  the most commonly used password)

If there exists a subsequence that tests positive when looked up against the `Dictionary` , a `DictionaryMatch` is created to note down the details of the subsequence.

[NOTE]
A `Match` is an object that is created to encapsulate the details of any matches found when analysing a given password. Each `Analyser` will create it's respective `Match` when needed.

Thus, we see that the method `#getAllMatches(password)` will return a list of all `DictionaryMatch` found for a given password.

As long as a `DictionaryMatch` is found, then the password has failed the analysis. A `DictionaryResult` with the attribute `ResultOutcome.FAIL` will be created for that password. This process is repeated for every password. Following, the list of `DictionaryResult` are returned to be compiled and written by the `AnalysisReport`.

The following sequence diagram depicts the flow of events mentioned above:

.Sequence diagram depicting the flow of getting all Match objects for a given password.
image::GetAllMatchesSequence.png[]

It is also worth mentioning that `DictionaryAnalyser` is capable of identifying commonly used passwords even in leet-ed variations (e.g. p@5sw0rd).

This is made possible because of the method `#LeetUtil.translateLeet()`, which is a recursive algorithm designed to return all possible un-leet variations, given a leet-ed password. The details of the algorithm can be found here:

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How analyse/analyse strong executes
|===
|**Alternative 1 (Current choice)**|**Alternative 2**

| **Always analyse the entire list of Password objects for every "analyse" command,
even if the list of Passwords was unchanged.** +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Easy to implement, not required to check state if the current list of Passwords has been modified.
 +

[underline]_Cons:_ +
May have performance issues in terms of speed of the programme.
|**Save in memory the result produced by the Analyser objects, and update result upon modification of
list of Passwords (e.g. new passwords added/ passwords deleted.)** +
 +
[underline]_Pros:_ +
Performance of programme will be a lot faster and efficient. +

[underline]_Cons:_ +
Hard to implement. Have to keep track of state of the list of Password objects and check if the list has been modified
from the last time they were analysed.

2+|**Why did we choose Alternative 1:** +
From a more practical point of view, users are not expected to constantly want to keep analysing their passwords, so it may be a waste of memory to constantly save the results, as per Alternative 2.

Also, considering the fact that each password is capped at a length of 25, time performance will not be affected significantly when analysing each password.

=== Data Encryption

==== Initialization and Validation

All data files of SecureIT are encrypted with a master password set by the user. The initialization and validation of the master password is handled by `TestStorage`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the master password is initialized when the user uses the app for the first time, and validated for subsequent uses of the app.

image::InitPasswordSequenceDiagram.png[]

Note that the main components of the app (`Storage`, `Ui`, `Logic`, `Model`) can only be initialised with a correct master password.

The app does not store the master password itself. Instead, during initialization, the app encrypts a magic word using the password and stores it in the storage. For validation, the app tries to decrypt the stored magic word using the password given and compares if the original word is obtained. If the password given is correct, the decrypted magic word should be the same as the original one.

==== Encryption Method

The following sequence diagram explains how the `EncryptionUtil` class encrypts an input byte array (`byte[] input`) using using a password (`String pwd`).

image::EncryptionUtilSequenceDiagram.png[]

Before the encryption, both a key (`SecretKey key`) and a set of parameter specification (`PBEParameterSpec paramSpec`) are required. The key is generated from the password string and a specified encryption method (`PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES`) via a utility class (`SecretKeyFactory`). On the other hand, the parameter specification is generated with hardcoded parameters (`SALT`, `ITERATION`). Hardcoded parameters ensure that the same password can always be correctly validated at different times.

Finally, a `Cipher` class is constructed with the same encryption method specified above (`PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES`) and initialised with the key and the set of parameter specifications. The `doFinal` method conducts the actual encryption on the input array and returns the encrypted byte array.

The decryption process is similar to the encryption process, except that the `ENCRYPT_MODE` is changed to `DECRYPT_MODE`. The same password is necessary to decrypt an encrypted byte array to its original content.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Notes Feature
==== Key basic features
=======
Within the notes feature, the user will be able to perform operations to `add`, `open`, `delete` and `edit` a note.

The `open` command allows users to open the note in a separate panel to edit and save through the UI of the app.
The following sequence diagram illustrates how the note is retrieved and editable via the `open` command.

image::OpenNoteSequenceDiagram.png[]

Below is the sub-diagram for retrieving the note through the `open` command.
****
* Note that the sequence diagram for `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands are similar to the one below, hence are omitted.
****

image::OpenNoteSequenceDiagramRef.png[]

==== Undo/Redo
===== Implementation
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the VersionedNoteBook, which extends NoteBook with a undo/redo history.
This history is stored in two stacks - the undo stack which store the history of NoteBooks before the current state and
the redo stack which stores the history of NoteBooks after the current state. The key operations that support this mechanisms are:

`VersionedNoteBook#commit()` — Saves the current NoteBook state and its corresponding command in its history.

`VersionedNoteBook#undo()` — Restores the previous note book state from its history and returns its corresponding command
to inform the user what command is undone.

`VersionedNoteBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone note book state from its history and returns its corresponding
command to inform the user what command is redone.

Below is a comprehensive activity diagram to illustrate how the undo/redo mechanism works.

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[]

Undo-able and redo-able commands are commands that modify the modifies the note book. They include: `add`, `delete`,
`clear`, `edit` and `open`. `open` command is considered undo-able and redo-able because it updates the number of access
to the note opened.

On an undo command, the current state of the note book is first stored in the history (NoteBook's redo stack) before being
reverted to the previous notebook state. The previous notebook state is then removed from its history (NoteBook's undo stack).

Similarly, on a redo command, the current state of the note book is first stored in the history (NoteBook's undo stack) before being
restored to the next notebook state. The next notebook state is then removed from its history (NoteBook's redo stack).


When an undoable command is executed, the current state of the `NoteBook` is checked against its previous NoteBook state in
its history within the commit command. The current state of the `NoteBook` is only saved to its history if it is not equals to
the previous one. Similarly, the same check is done on `VersionedNoteBook#undo()` command, and only if the current state is not
equal to the previous one, will the current state be set to the state of its previous `NoteBook`. This is to prevent users from being
able to perform undo and redo actions when there is no change to be undone or redone.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Saves the entire note book.
** Pros: Easy to implement and can check if current state of note book is equals to previous state of note book easily.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* Alternative 2: Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Makes use of lesser memory.
** Cons: More complex to implement and more prone to bugs because each individual command must be correct to work correctly.

The reason why we chose alternative 1 is to introduce less bugs by adopting a less complex implementation which works
well with our undo & redo mechanism.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use two stacks to store the history of note book states - one for undo, one for redo.
** Pros: Very easy to implement.
** Cons: Using two data structures may incur additional overhead in terms of memory.

* Alternative 2: Use a single linked list to store the history of note book states that supports both undo and redo.
** Pros: May incur less overhead in terms of memory usage as only one data structure is used.
** Cons: More complex to implement.

The reason why we chose alternative 1 is because it is less complex to implement and the code is much cleaner for better
readability which helps in future extensions.

==== Sort Note feature


=======
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
