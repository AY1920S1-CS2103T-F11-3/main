== Introduction

Welcome to SecureIT!

Tired of having to keep track of all your confidential information? Look no further!
SecureIT is specifically designed to help manage your confidential information all in one application. More importantly,
it *stores your information locally,*  and does not use any form of online storage!


SecureIT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For those of you who are type fast, SecureIT can get can manage your confidential information faster than traditional GUI apps.


Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Basic Information
This following guide will teach you how you can use `SecureIT` to keep track of your confidential information so you will never have to worry about your information ever again.

Confused? You refer to <<Quick Start>> for a simple set-up.

If you are overwhelmed by all the instructions and don't know which one to use, our <<CheatSheet of commands>> is here to help you.

The following list of icons below will assist you to understand our material:

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `SecureIT.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your *SecureIT*.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Since this is the first time that you are using *SecureIT*, you will be asked to create a new master password. Type your preferred master password in the command box and hit the `Enter` key.
.  With that, you have created your very own *SecureIT* account. You can now enter commands in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+

+
.  Here are some example commands that you can try out:
* `add d/Gmail u/randomGuy p/qwerty123` : adds a password with username 'randomGuy' and password 'qwerty123'
* `analyse` : briefly analyses all your passwords and produces a security report
* `analyse strong/1` : analyses your first password and produces a detailed security report
* `generate` : generates a random strong password for you
* `encrypt <filepath>` : encrypts the file in the specified filepath
.  You may refer to <<Features>> for more details of all our available commands.

You can easily adds cards to the application.

Format: `add d/DESCRIPTION c/CARDNUMBER v/CVC e/EXPIRY [t/TAG]`

Example: `add d/VisaPOSB c/5203123458392748 v/456 e/12/25 t/groceries`

=== File

SecureIT has a file manager which helps you keep secret files that you do not wish others to see. Using your master password, SecureIT convert your files into encrypted code which other apps cannot understand.

To access the file manager, simply enter `goto file` in the command box.

==== Encrypting a file : `encrypt`

Encrypts a local file as specified by its file path. The file's content is converted into encrypted code which other apps cannot understand. Encrypted files have the prefix `[LOCKED]` in their file names.

As you encrypt the file, you may tag the file at the same time for easy reference later on.

Format: `encrypt FILEPATH [t/TAG]...`

Example: `encrypt ~/Desktop/Secret File.png t/Image`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* Instead of typing the file path, you can drag the file into the input field to easily append the file path. This also applies to other commands (e.g. `add`).
* The app may freeze for some time if the file to be encrypted is large. Please do not force exit the app during encryption.
* The app does not support encryption of files larger than 2GB.
====

====
--
image::warning.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Warning*

* The `encrypt` command only alters the file content but does not set up additional access rights. In other words, it keeps your information secret but does not keep your files safe from malicious alteration or deletion.
* If you wish to prevent alternation or deletion of files, please set up additional access rights using your operating system. SecureIT is not responsible for any data loss resulting from lack of access right settings.
* If you are using Windows, please close the file before encryption.
====

==== Decrypting a file : `decrypt`

Decrypts a local file as specified by the displayed index number.

Format: `decrypt INDEX`

Example: `decrypt 1` (This command decrypts the first file in the displayed file list.)

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* If you notice that the file decryption fails, it may be because you have renamed the file or moved the file to another location without using SecureIT (for example, using your operating system directly).
* In that case, use `remove` command to remove the file from the list first, and then use `add` command to add the renamed/moved file. Please refer to the `remove` and `add` command sections for detailed instructions.
====

==== Adding an encrypted file : `add`

Adds an encrypted file as specified by its file path. The file must be encrypted by SecureIT previously.

As you add the file, you may tag the file at the same time for easy reference later on.

Format: `add FILENAME [t/TAG]...`

Example: `add ~/Desktop/[LOCKED] Secret File.png t/Image`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The file name does not have to contain the prefix `[LOCKED]`. SecureIT can recognise the file and automatically prepend the prefix.
====

==== Removing a file : `remove`

Removes an encrypted file record as specified by the displayed index number.

Please note that only the file record within SecureIT is removed. The actual file is not deleted from the file system.

Format: `remove INDEX`

Example: `remove 1`

====
--
image::warning.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Warning*

* The "encrypted at" and "last edited at" timestamps are stored within SecureIT and will be discarded if you remove the record from SecureIT. They are not recoverable even if you add the file back using `add` command.
====

==== Renaming an encrypted file : `rename`

Renames an encrypted file as specified by its index number. The prefix `[LOCKED]` is retained.

Format: `rename INDEX TARGET_FILENAME`

Example: `rename 1 Secret File.txt`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The file extension of the file is retained using `rename` command. If you give a file extension in the target file name, it will be ignored.
====

==== Moving an encrypted file : `move`

Moves an encrypted file as specified by its index number.

Format: `move INDEX TARGET_DIRECTORY`

Example: `move 1 ~/Documents/Secret File.png`

====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* It is recommended to rename and move files using SecureIT to better manage your files.
* If you have renamed or moved your files without using SecureIT (for example, using the operating system directly), you have to use `remove` command to remove the file from the list first, and then use `add` command to add the renamed/moved file.
====

==== Finding encrypted files : `find`

Finds matching encrypted files as specified by the search keywords.

To return from search results, use `list` command.

Format: `find KEYWORDS...`

Examples: `find Secret File`
====
--
image::tip.png[width = "20", float = "left"]
--
*Tip*

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `secret file` will match `Secret File`.
* Both the file name and the file path are searched. Hence, you can look for files with certain types (e.g. `find .png .jpg`) or files inside certain directories (e.g. `find /Desktop`).
====

==== Listing all files : `list`

Lists all encrypted files managed by SecureIT.

Format: `list`
