== Introduction

FinSec is a Financial Planner that helps the finance secretaries of any department in NUS, preferably from the School of Computing so that they would be more likely to like the idea of having a CLI app.
The app focuses on the tracking of claims that will help the While FinSec has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), its main form of input is Command Line Interface (CLI) based, thus favoring people who can type fast. Starting using it now and enjoy!
