== Introduction

Welcome to SecureIT!

Tired of having to keep track of all your confidential information? Look no further!
SecureIT is specifically designed to help manage your confidential information all in one application. More importantly,
it *stores your information locally,*  and does not use any form of online storage!


SecureIT is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For those of you who are type fast, SecureIT can get can manage your confidential information faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `SecureIT.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your *SecureIT*.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Since this is the first time that you are using *SecureIT*, you will be asked to create a new master password. Type your preferred master password in the command box and hit the `Enter` key.
.  With that, you have created your very own *SecureIT* account. You can now enter commands in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.

* `analyse` : briefly analyses all your passwords and produces a security report
* `analyse strong/1` : analyses your first password and produces a detailed security report
* `generate` : generates a random strong password for you
* `encrypt <filepath>` : encrypts the file in the specified filepath
