== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 3


== Overview

The purpose of this document is to showcase my contributions to SecureIT, a group project developed by my team under the
Software Engineering module (CS2103T) in NUS. In this module, my team and I were tasked to enhance a basic command line
interface desktop application called _Address Book 3 (AB3)_. We have decided to morph AB3 to become our current product - SecureIT.

This is a snapshot of how SecureIT looks like!

== About this Project
SecureIT is a secure information management system that enables office workers to securely manage important data such as
passwords, notes, files and credit card information completely offline.
Users are able to interact with SecureIT via the Command-line Interface (CLI) which requires users to issue commands
to the application in the form of successive lines of text.
My role in this project was to design and implement all features related to notes in SecureIT.

In this document, I will be providing detailed descriptions and explanations to illustrate
my contributions to SecureIT’s key features. I have also included the relevant documentations from the user and
developer guide to aid in the illustration of the application’s key features.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: gives users the ability to undo and redo commands one at a time.
Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to sort the note book*
** What it does: gives users the ability to sort the notes in the note book using different conditions.
Users are able to sort the note book using more than one condition at one time.
** Justification: This features is very useful for users because users should be able to view their notes in the order
that is most relevant to them and the app should provide a convenient way to sort them accordingly.
notes most relevant to them are arranged at the top.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future.
It requires a non trivial implementation of the Java's Comparator class to achieve multi-variable sort.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Added *the ability to open note*
** What it does: gives users the ability to open a note and edit it through the UI.
** Justification: This feature helps make reading and editing notes in the app much easier, which is required for an enhanced
user experience.
** Highlights: To implement this feature, an additional UI panel was created to display the note.
This UI panel supports editing of the note's contents directly and saving the changes back to the note.
The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
