== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented a series of commands and features to manage user's password. This includes adding a `Password` model
and its subclasses of `Description`, `Username`, `PasswordValue`, `Website`, `ModifiedAt`, `ExpiryMode` and others, as well as
implementing the `AddPasswordCommand`, `FindPasswordCommand`, `CopyPasswordCommand`,`DeletePasswordCommand`,
`ReadPasswordCommand`, `EditPasswordCommand` commands.
** What it does: allows the user manage personal passwords and keep track of when they should change their passwords.
** Justification: Businesses now have a plethora of accounts to use for day-to-day activities.
It is hard to keep track of all the passwords without compromising on security.
** Highlights:


* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
