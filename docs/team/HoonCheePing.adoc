== Summary of contributions

*Major enhancement*

Implemented a series of commands and features to manage user's password. This includes adding a `Password` model
and its subclasses of `Description`, `Username`, `PasswordValue`, `Website`, `ModifiedAt`, `ExpiryMode`. In addition,
I implemented the supportive commands to the password model such as `AddPasswordCommand`, `FindPasswordCommand`, `CopyCommand`, `DeletePasswordCommand`,
`ReadPasswordCommand` and `EditPasswordCommand`  commands.

*What it does*

* Allows the user manage passwords and keep track of when they should change their passwords.

*Justification*

* Many small and medium enterprises now have a plethora of accounts to use for day-to-day activities.
It is hard to keep track of all the passwords without compromising on security. This feature aims to alleviate the password management
on businesses and improve data security.

*Highlights*

* This enhancement requires good adherence to the existing architecture as it touches all components
of the architecture. A new `Password` model was created to support the storage of passwords.
In addition, numerous commands were implemented for this enhancement. Besides, several Software Engineering Principles,
such as SOLID, YAGNI and DRY Principles, were closely followed.
